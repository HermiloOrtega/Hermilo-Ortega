# **HermiloOrtega.com**  

## 🧭 Overview  
**HermiloOrtega.com** is a personal portfolio website created to showcase my experience, projects, skills, and background in a dynamic and professional one-page design. The goal of this web app is to serve as a digital resume and central point of contact for potential employers, clients, or collaborators.

The site was built using **React** and customized from a premium template purchased on **ThemeForest**. I tailored the design, structure, and content to reflect my brand and professional identity.
